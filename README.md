## Qiskit

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts exploring
quantum computing concepts and algorithms using **Qiskit**, IBMâ€™s open-source
quantum development framework.

### Contents
- **VQE_single_qubit_qiskit.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) on a single-qubit
  Hamiltonian, including state preparation, ansatz design, and optimization.

- **qaoa.ipynb**  
  Implements the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for
  combinatorial optimization problems.

### Highlights
- Examples of creating and simulating quantum circuits.
- Step-by-step use of Qiskit primitives (`Estimator`, `Sampler`) with
  classical optimizers.
- Clear, educational notebooks suitable for learning or as a starting
  point for new projects.

These resources are ideal for anyone beginning with Qiskit or
experimenting with variational algorithms on real or simulated
quantum hardware.
