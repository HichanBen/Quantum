## 📂 Repository Structure

### `Algorithmes`
Core quantum algorithms and variational methods.

- **VQE_single_qubit_qiskit.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** on a simple 1-qubit Hamiltonian.  
  Covers Pauli operator decomposition, TwoLocal ansatz, and hybrid classical-quantum optimization.

- **qaoa.ipynb**  
  Implements the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** for solving a combinatorial problem (e.g., MaxCut).  
  Shows QUBO mapping, cost/mixer Hamiltonians, and optimizer performance.

### `ApplicationsVQE`
Applications of VQE to more realistic systems.

- **OHQ_VQE.ipynb**  
  Applies VQE to a molecular or oscillator Hamiltonian (example of higher-dimensional or chemical use cases).  
  Includes Hamiltonian construction, variational ansatz, and convergence analysis.

### `Bell_states`
Illustrates entanglement and state preparation.

- **bell_states.ipynb**  
  Prepares and measures **Bell states**.  
  Demonstrates entanglement creation, measurement statistics, and quantum correlations.
